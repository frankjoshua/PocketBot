So, what is PocketBot?  Well, robots come in all shapes and sizes.  Some do a little and some do a lot.  Some take just hours to build, and some take years.  But all of them require a “User Interface”.

PocketBot lets you use an Android device as your robot’s User Interface.  What’s that mean?  It means you can:


– Give vocal commands to your robot.
– Control your robot with a joystick on your Android phone.
– Use your robot as a telepresence device and control it with the video feed.
– Take advantage of your Android device’s gyroscope and GPS to give even more abilities to your robot.
On top of that, PocketBot is a fun, engaging UI with great features!
– Connect to ROS (Robotic Operating Ssytem) master
– Stream sensor data to ROS

– Uses social cues to engage in realistic interactions with the user.
– Bright, colorful faces and emotions.
– High-level communication skills and customizable dialogue.
